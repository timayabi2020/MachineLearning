We want to find the maximum solution to:
Z=4x+3yZ=4x+3y
This is known as our objective function. x and y in this equation are our decision variables.
In this example, the objective function is subject to the following constraints:
x≥0
y≥2 ----- blue line
2y≤25–x ----green line
4y≥2x–8 -----red line
y≤2x−5 ------ light blue line

Our solution lies somewhere in the grey feasible region in the graph above.
It has been proven that the minima and maxima of linear programming problems lie at the vertices of the feasible region.
 In this example, there are only 4 corners to our feasible region,
  so we can find the solutions for each corner to find our maximum.

  y≥2 and 4y≥2x–8
  2=2x–8/4
  x=8
  y=2
  Z=(4×8+3×2)=38
